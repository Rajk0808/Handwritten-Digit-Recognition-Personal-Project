## üìö Project Overview

The repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that guide through the process of building, training, and evaluating a neural network for digit recognition. The project is structured to provide a step-by-step understanding of:

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model architecture design
- Training and validation processes
- Performance evaluation and optimization

## üß† Model Architecture

The neural network model is designed using TensorFlow and consists of:

- Input layer corresponding to the 28x28 pixel images
- One or more hidden layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU)
- Output layer with 10 neurons representing digits 0 through 9, using softmax activation

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
